> TerrAlert is a system designed to monitor and analyze natural disasters using both historical and real-time data. It processes past disaster records and combines them with live earthquake data, helping to quickly identify the most vulnerable areas in need of resources during crises.

> Big Picture: The main goal of TerrAlert is to help disaster relief organizations quickly spot ongoing or potential disasters in key areas, making it easier to allocate resources. By integrating real-time data with historical information, the system aims to give decision-makers a clear picture of disaster situations, helping them respond faster and manage aid better.

> While the current version focuses on data processing and visualization, future updates will enhance TerrAlertâ€™s ability to automatically detect high-risk areas and predict zones prone to disasters, getting closer to achieving the full vision of the system.

<!-- Tech stack -->

###  Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.

###  Precision in Development: Harnessing the Power of Unit Testing:

- This project employs rigorous unit testing methodologies to ensure the reliability and accuracy of code components. By systematically evaluating individual units of the software, we guarantee a robust foundation, identifying and addressing potential issues early in the development process.
