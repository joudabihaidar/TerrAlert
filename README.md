> TerrAlert is a system designed to monitor and analyze natural disasters using both historical and real-time data. It processes past disaster records and combines them with live earthquake data, helping to quickly identify the most vulnerable areas in need of resources during crises.

> Big Picture: The main goal of TerrAlert is to help disaster relief organizations quickly spot ongoing or potential disasters in key areas, making it easier to allocate resources. By integrating real-time data with historical information, the system aims to give decision-makers a clear picture of disaster situations, helping them respond faster and manage aid better.

> While the current version focuses on data processing and visualization, future updates will enhance TerrAlertâ€™s ability to automatically detect high-risk areas and predict zones prone to disasters, getting closer to achieving the full vision of the system.

### User Stories
- As a disaster relief coordinator, I want to monitor real-time data to quickly identify affected regions in need of aid.
- As an analyst, I want to explore historical records of natural disasters to understand trends, impacts, and the responses taken.
- As a data engineer, I want to build a scalable ETL pipeline to continuously update and manage disaster-related data for analysis.

###  TerrAlert is built using the following technologies:

- Python for developing the ETL pipeline and integrating real-time data using the USGS API for earthquake data.
- PostgreSQL as a data warehouse for efficient storage of both real-time and historical disaster data, enabling complex queries and analysis.
- Power BI for creating interactive dashboards to analyze the human and economic impacts of disasters.
- Plotly for real-time visualization of earthquake data, providing a dynamic map of earthquake locations and their magnitudes.
